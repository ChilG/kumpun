# 🐱 Kumpun Framework

**Kumpun** is a lightweight, schema-first API framework powered by **Rust** and **JSON Schema**. Built from scratch with love and inspired by a cat named Kumpun, it's designed for developers who want performance, validation, and flexibility without losing fun.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Schema-First**: Define your input/output using JSON Schema
- ⚡  **Rust Core**: High-performance validation and dispatch
- 🔄 **Auto Docs**: Generate documentation from schema (WIP)
- 🛠️ **CLI Tools**: Fast mock, validate, and simulate APIs
- 🌐 **Cross-language Ready**: Schema can be consumed by any language

## 📖 Philosophy

- **Validate at the edge**: Keep your APIs clean, predictable, and fast
- **Make schema a first-class citizen**
- **Have fun while building tools**

> Kumpun is not just another API tool. It's your cat-powered API engine 😸
